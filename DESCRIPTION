Description: The Capr package provides a programming language for defining OHDSI cohort definitions in R. 
    The functions in Capr allow for the programmatic creation of OHDSI concept sets and cohorts that can be serialized 
    to Atlas/CIRCE-BE compatible json files or to OHDSI-SQL. Capr functions can be used to create, save, and load 
    component parts to a cohort definition allowing R programmers to easily reuse cohort logic. Capr provides tools
    to create a large number of OHDSI cohorts programmatically while also helping bridge the gap between human readable
    descriptions of clinical phenotypes and their computational implmentation.
